# Stock-Market-Prediction
This project aims to explore if text mining from Twitter could predict stock prices. To see if it's effective, we test the model on both MSFT and AAPL. We did a classification on the changes for the stock as the target values, and performed a random forest classifcation on the text vectorizer.
